    "\n",
    "Let's start off simple. If we want to find the minimum value we use the following code:\n",
    "***\n",
    "```python\n",
    "min_args, min_dist = (None, 9e99)  # initialize these variables outside the loop so their scope is defined globally and we can update and track their values at each iteration.\n",
    "for id_r, row in enumerate(dist):  # enumerate to not only iterate along the rows of dist but also to keep track of the row index we are at: id_r\n",
    "    dist_ = min(row)  # minimum distance in the current row\n",
    "    if dist_ <= min_dist:\n",
    "        min_dist = dist_  # if the minimum distance of the row is <= the minimum global distance, then we update the later\n",
    "        min_args = id_r  # and we also are able to know at which row index we found the minimum global distance!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step. Let's try to additionally find the column index responsible for the minimum global distance. Then, together with the row index we can know which observations are closest together (i.e. have the smallest distance):\n",
    "***\n",
    "```python\n",
    "min_args, min_dist = (None, 9e99)\n",
    "for id_r, row in enumerate(dist):\n",
    "    dist_ = min(row)\n",

    "            if dist_val == dist_:  # to find the column index responsible for the current minimum global distance we need to iterate along the current row distances and if at a given iteration we find that the corresponding distance is the same as the current minimum global distance, then we know that we the tracked column index id_c is the one responsible for the current minimum global distance\n",

Since the distance matrix is a symmetric and 0-diagonal matrix (distance of the observation with itself is 0) we should only perform the search over either the upper or lower traingle of the matrix. Let's implement this:\n",

We will only look for the minimum distance and the corresponding observations in these values\n",
    "    dist_ = min(row_relevant) if len(row_relevant)>0 else 9e99  # the if condition ensures we do not call the min() function on an empty list (happens at first iteration when id_r = 0)\n",
